## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/grok-desktop.git
   cd grok-desktop
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

### Building the Application

There are three ways to build the application:

#### Option 1: Manual Build (Recommended)

This creates a directory with all necessary files and a launcher script:

1. Run the manual build script:
   ```
   manual-build.bat
   ```
2. The application will be built in the `build\GrokDesktop` directory
3. A launcher batch file `start.bat` will be created in that directory
4. To run the application, double-click the `start.bat` file
5. To distribute, simply zip the `build\GrokDesktop` folder
6. Note: Users will need Node.js installed to run this version

#### Option 2: Simple Directory Build

This creates a directory with the application and a launcher batch file:

1. Run the simple build script:
   ```
   build-simple.bat
   ```
2. The application will be built in the `build\win-unpacked` directory
3. A launcher batch file `GrokDesktop.bat` will be created in the `build` directory
4. You can run the application by double-clicking the `GrokDesktop.bat` file
5. To distribute, simply zip the `build` folder

#### Option 3: Portable Executable Build

This creates a single portable executable file (requires administrator privileges):

```
npm run build-portable
```

The built portable executable will be available in the `build` directory.

### Quick Build (Windows)

For Windows users, batch files are included for easy building:

1. **Manual Build (Recommended)**: Double-click the `manual-build.bat` file
   - Creates a directory with all necessary files and a launcher script
   - No administrator privileges required
   - No symbolic link issues

2. **Simple Build**: Double-click the `build-simple.bat` file
   - Creates a directory with the application and a launcher
   - No administrator privileges required
   - Easy to distribute by zipping the folder
